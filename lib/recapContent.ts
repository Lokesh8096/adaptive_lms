            "• A variable in JavaScript is like a container used to store data values.\n• These values can represent numbers, text, or other data types that a program needs to work with.\n• The value stored in a variable can change during program execution, depending on how the variable is declared.\n\n• Every value stored inside a variable is called data.\n• Variables help programmers store data once and reuse or update it multiple times without rewriting the value again and again.\n\n• JavaScript allows variable declaration using let, const, and var.\n\n• Example: Imagine a program that stores a user's age. Initially, the age is 10.\n• Later, when the user grows older, the value needs to be updated.\n• Instead of changing the value everywhere in the program, the programmer changes it in one place by updating the variable.\n• This shows how variables act as containers whose values can change.",

These properties help control how text appears on a webpage. You will understand how to import fonts using Google Fonts and apply them using the font-family property. You will also learn how font-size controls text size using pixel (px) units, how font-style changes text appearance (normal, italic, oblique), how font-weight adjusts text thickness using keywords or numeric values from 100 to 900, and how text-decoration adds effects like underline, overline, or line-through. Understanding these properties is essential for creating visually appealing and readable web pages.",

You will import fonts from Google Fonts using the @import rule and apply them using the font-family property. You will experiment with font-size using pixel values such as 28px and 36px. Then, you will modify font-style to make text italic or normal, and use font-weight values like bold, 200, or 700 to change thickness. You will also apply text-decoration values like underline, overline, and line-through to observe how text appearance changes.

          explanation:
            "• JavaScript executes code sequentially, meaning it runs one instruction after another from top to bottom. By default, every line of code executes in order. However, in real-world programs, we often need certain instructions to execute only when a specific condition is satisfied. This is where conditional statements are used. Conditional execution allows the program flow to change depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false.",

If it evaluates to false, the block is skipped.",
